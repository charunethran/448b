	  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The objective of this project is to devise an interactive and narrative visualization to allow users to explore data related to climate change, and the effects of climate change on their lives. We do this by splitting the narrative into three main distinctions:<br>
Billion Dollar Disasters - this visualization utilizes a timeline to depict all the recent natural disasters that have cost the United States more than a billion dollars each.<br>
Climate Negotiations Summary and Carbon Emissions Data by Country - this visualization allows users to explore various carbon emission metrics and current international climate negotiation status by country.<br>
Sea Level Rise Map - this visualization overlays a map showing projected sea level rise of 15 feet over a map of present coastlines. </p>
<br><br>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The Earth’s climate has always been through periods of change. However, over the past few decades, the implications of increasing fluctuations in weather patterns have led to a recognition of the fact that human activities have a major influence on the climate. There has been extensive monitoring, measurement and study of the influencing factors, the behavior and interaction of emissions and effluents, and the predictive modeling of consequences of these factors increasing in concentration. The science has always been debated and analyzed, and opinions differ from the international to the individual level. At a most basic level, the understanding has reached the extent that there are now extended international negotiations to decide the future course of action as far as mitigating the detrimental effect of global warming. The Environment and its protection has also become important enough to be a deciding factor in democratic processes, in policy making, in trade and in the setting of standards. </p>

<p>As of December 2012, the 18th Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) had just concluded at Doha, Qatar.  The COP is an association of all the countries that are Parties to the Convention. It is the 'supreme body' of the Convention and its highest decision-making authority. In 1988, the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to synthesize all climate change-related research and provide a scientific review of the current state of climate knowledge. As a result of the IPCC assessments, Parties realized that in order to address the actions that drive climate change, concrete commitments were required from participating countries, and this led to the negotiation of a protocol beginning in 1995. </p>

<p>The Kyoto Protocol was adopted in Kyoto, Japan, on 11 December 1997. It commits industrialized countries to stabilize GHGs, according to the levels agreed to in the Protocol, instead of simply encouraging them to do so, as the Convention does. This agreement represented the first time that binding emission reductions targets were set for 37 industrialized countries. The Kyoto Protocol’s “first commitment period” covered the period of 2008-2012. During these four years, the 37 countries were to reduce their GHG emissions by an average of 5% compared with their GHG emission levels in 1990. The Kyoto Protocol focuses on developed countries, because there was recognition that they were to be held “historically responsible” for the increase in GHGs. Developing countries were not bound by specific emission reduction targets through the Kyoto Protocol. Developed countries, as well as countries in transition to a market economy, are known as Annex I Parties under the UNFCCC. In order to enter into force, the Protocol needed ratification by at least 55 Parties, and those Parties needed to account for at least 55% of global carbon dioxide emissions in 1990. This threshold was reached at the end of 2004, and the Protocol became a legally-binding instrument on 16 February 2005. </p>

<p>At the COP 18, several countries refused to enter into a second commitment period for the Kyoto Protocol. Only a handful of Annex 1 countries have pledged to continue, while Non-Annex 1 or developing nations have little added pressure or incentive to change their developmental strategies. Opinions on the issue are still varied, and there is little consensus on the trajectory forward.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>With this background, it is easy to see a need to spread awareness about the lack of progress in international negotiations and to make the mitigation of climate change a relevant and important issue for the ordinary citizen. Most popular awareness campaigns aim to simplify raw data or scientific studies to cater to a lowest common denominator. We felt that this approach might be counter-productive. Instead, transparency and direct interaction with the real data in a visual setting could engage people more thoroughly, help them delve into the numbers, make comparisons and gauge established conclusions for themselves.</p>

<p>Therefore, the primary question facing the team was whether there was a compelling visual method by which a user could be presented with the data behind these climate negotiations. Additionally, how would this visualization strike an emotional response in the user? How personal must the context be allowed to be in order to do so?  Helping to personalize the information on an individual level would help make the issue that much closer to their lives.</p>

<p>By setting high expectations on the neutrality of data sources, we were able to approach the visualization from an unbiased perspective. Additionally, we set high standards on the types of tools and frameworks we would employ in order to be able to develop simple and useful visualizations. Driven by these motivations and by wanting to utilize our learnings from the course, we were able to set the expectations on this project.</p>
