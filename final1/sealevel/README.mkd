This example is a simple [loupe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loupe) using [Polymaps](http://polymaps.org). Drag the center of the loupe to move it around, or drag the thick border to resize it. Loupes are normally used to magnify, showing focus and context, but in this example we're using it to show two different tilesets. You can enable magnification (or minification) using the `zoomDelta` property.
